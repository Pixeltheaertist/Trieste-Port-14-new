  # Roleplay a normal person
  - Do not use texting/messaging acronyms (ex: "lol", "wtf", "brb", "lmao", "thx", "sgtm") or emoticons (ex: ":)", "xD") in-character.
  - Do not mention out-of-character (OOC) concepts like game admins or developers in character.
  - Do not use emotes to bypass muted or accented speech.
  - Do not use extremely low effort or impossible emotes.
  - Additionally, player characters are typically considered to be of relatively sound mind at the start of a round, for instance fearing death.
  - While playing a character not of sound mind is not expressly forbidden, this would require high quality roleplay, and avoid stereotyping or caricaturing.
  - Self-Harm/Killing: Self-killing is only allowed in the very rare circumstance that your character would have no other way out of a situation, and should not be dwelled upon.
  - [color=#ff0000]"It's what my character would do" or variations thereof are never an excuse for breaking game or roleplay rules[/color]

  ## Examples
  Things you should not do:
  - Say "lol did u c wat just happened" using in-character chat.
  - Say "an admin exploded him" using in-character chat.
  - Emote "can you give me some cheese" as a mouse.
  - Emote "motions for you to order guns" or "asks you to order guns in sign language" as a mime.

  Things you could do instead:
  - Say "haha did you see what just happened?"
  - Say "god blew him up" or "centcomm must have bluespaced a bomb to him"
  - Point at cheese
  - Point at the cargo order console then emote "shoots finger guns"
